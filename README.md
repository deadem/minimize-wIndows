### Description

This program intercepts the Win+D keyboard shortcut on Windows operating systems. Unlike the standard behavior of minimizing or restoring all windows across all monitors, this utility only minimizes or restores windows on the main monitor, leaving the windows on additional monitors untouched.

This utility is perfect for users who work with multiple monitors and want to keep the secondary monitor's content visible while minimizing or restoring windows on the main monitor. For example, if you have reference material or ongoing tasks displayed on a secondary monitor, this utility ensures that those windows remain undisturbed when you use the Win+D shortcut.
